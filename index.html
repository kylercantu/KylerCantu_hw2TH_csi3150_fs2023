          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello current reader(s), my name is Kyler and I'm from Troy,
            Michigan! I'm currently attending Oakland University and pursuing a
            Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Prior to majoring in Computer
            Science, I spent about two and a half years pursuing an entirely
            different degree, which was Criminal Justice. I come from a Law
            Enforcement family and always thought that's what I wanted to do in
            the future, but at the same time I was always the kid who loved
            playing with technology/electronics. I've always heard about
            coding/programming growing up but never thought that I could do it
            since I had zero experience and never wrote a single line of code
            once in my life. Fast forward to my college years, while still
            pursuing my Criminal Justice Degree, I decided to attend an Intro to
            Coding Workshop at Grand Circus in Detroit which was a one-day two
            hour session where they taught the very basics of the java
            programming language. Ever since I wrote that first line of code, I
            knew that this is what I wanted to do!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My short term goal while I'm still a student is to get internships
            so that I can gain knowledge and understand how the industry works
            in the real world. For my long term goal in this profession, as of
            right now, I would like to hopefully become a back-end engineer! To
